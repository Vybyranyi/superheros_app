# Superhero Project
This project combines a React + TS frontend and a Node.js backend.

## Getting Started

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` folder:
    
    `cd server`
   `npm run dev` 
    
2.  In another terminal, navigate to the `app` folder:
    
    `cd app`
    `npm run dev` 
    

This way, both frontend and backend will run simultaneously.

## Notes

-   Make sure to install all dependencies with `npm install` in each folder.
